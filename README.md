This project will test your knowledge of front-end web development and ask you to apply everything you've learned in this course. The result will be a website that you can add to your portfolio.

- Apply knowledge gained during this course by building a website from scratch
- Use your creativity - your instructor will validate feasibility and manage scope

## Requirements

  - Use HTML5 structural elements (header, footer, nav, footer)
  - Demonstrate correct use of classes and IDs
  - Select the appropriate tags to markup content
2. Use CSS to style the page:
  - Apply fonts, color, and styles to elements and the page

## Timeline
Besides the project proposal (due by Lesson 13) and your final presentation + project code (due the last day of class), there are no deliverables here.

Milestones 2, 3 and 4 are just for you to keep in mind and to help you stay on track.

However, keep in mind that you should absolutely not leave the entire project for the final weekend before our last class!

Take advantage of office hours and check in with your instructional team if you ever have questions!
